# guess_it

guess_it
This is a _simple_ Python program that generates a random number between **1 and 10** and allows the user to guess the number in **3 attempts**. The program provides hints to the user, telling them if their guess is too high or too low.

## Installation

1. Install Python 3 on your computer.

2. Download or clone the source code from this repository.

## Usage

2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.

3. Run the following command to start the game:

_python guess_it.py_

4. Follow the prompts to play the game.

## How it works

The program uses the random module to _generate a random number_ between **1 and 10**. The user has **3 attempts** to **guess the number**. If the user's guess is incorrect, _the program provides a hint to the user_, telling them if their guess is too high or too low. If the user guesses the number correctly within the given number of attempts, the program congratulates the user and asks if they want to play again. If the user does not guess the number correctly within the given number of attempts, the program reveals the secret number and asks if the user wants to play again.
